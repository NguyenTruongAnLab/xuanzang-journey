# Updates Q4 2024 - UI/UX Improvements

## Summary
Major improvements to the Xuanzang Journey website interface for better Vietnamese user experience.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Panel Size and Positioning
- **Right Summary Panel**: Width doubled from 320px to 640px
- **Left Illustration Panel**: Width doubled from 380px to 760px
- **Both panels**: Moved lower (from top: 70px to top: 100px) to avoid overlap with map controls
- **Panel heights**: Increased vertical space (max-height: calc(100vh - 250px)) to reduce scrolling

### 2. Distance Units
- **All distances converted from miles to kilometers**
  - Total journey: 10,000 miles → 16,000 km
  - Updated in HTML, i18n translations, and modal content

### 3. Vietnamese Language Support
- **Chinese name transliteration**: Ancient names now show romanized Vietnamese pronunciation instead of Chinese characters (e.g., "建志補羅 (Jiànzhìbǔluó)" → "Jiànzhìbǔluó")
- **Compact info display**: Location details merged into single lines in Vietnamese mode to save vertical space
  - Format: "Tên hiện đại: [name]; Tên cổ đại: [ancient]; Quốc gia: [country]; Thời gian: [duration]"
- **Dynamic language switching**: Map labels and markers update automatically when language changes

### 4. Map Enhancements
- **City/Country labels**: Added permanent tooltips for major stops (start, end, major) showing city and country names
- **Directional arrows**: Added arrow markers along the journey path to clearly show travel direction
- **Grid line removal**: CSS rules added to hide latitude/longitude grid lines for cleaner appearance
- **Map labels localization**: Labels update based on selected language (EN/VI)

### 5. Monk Avatar on Map
- **Visible on map**: Monk avatar now appears directly on the map at the current location
- **Animation**: Avatar moves smoothly between locations during playback
- **Initial display**: Avatar positioned at first location (Chang'an) on page load
- **Z-index optimization**: Avatar rendered above map features but below UI panels

### 6. Timeline Improvements
- **Vietnamese labels**: Timeline markers show Vietnamese location names when VI language is selected
- **Clear station labels**: Each marker displays year, city name, and country
- **Country context**: Background patterns added to suggest different regions (China, Central Asia, India, Return)

### 7. Responsive Design
- **Tablet optimization**: Panel widths adjusted for 769px-1024px screens
  - Illustration panel: 500px
  - Summary panel: 450px
- **Mobile unchanged**: Mobile view maintains compact layout for small screens

### 8. Accessibility
- **ARIA labels**: Maintained for all interactive elements
- **Keyboard navigation**: Timeline and controls remain keyboard-accessible
- **Visual contrast**: Labels use high-contrast colors for readability

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `index.html` - Updated distance display
- `styles.css` - Panel sizing, positioning, labels, grid removal
- `map.js` - Marker labels, language switching, Vietnamese name handling
- `i18n.js` - Updated distance translations to kilometers
- `timeline.js` - Vietnamese label support
- `timeline.css` - Background patterns for regions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Switch between EN and VI languages - verify all labels update
2. Check panel positioning - ensure no overlap with map controls
3. Test timeline navigation - verify Vietnamese names display correctly
4. Watch monk avatar - confirm it moves along the path during playback
5. Verify distance shown as "16,000 km" in all locations
6. Check responsive behavior on tablet (768px-1024px width)

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)
- Country-specific background images for timeline (would require sourcing/licensing images)
- Complete removal of color phase bands (kept for visual balance and orientation)
- Additional map annotations with historical context
