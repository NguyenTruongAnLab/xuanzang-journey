### Version 2.2 (January 2025)

  - **Rationale**: Simplified navigation experience, removed animation complexity, maintained journey visualization with clear departure and destination markers.
  - **Files Modified**: `avatar.js`, `map.js`, `timeline.js`, `styles.css`
  - **Commit**: Part of v2.2 release
  - **Date**: January 2025

## 📝 Diagnosis Notes

<!-- Add detailed diagnostic information for complex issues here -->

### Navigation System Architecture
- **State Management**: Uses `window.currentStepIndex` as single source of truth
- **Update Flow**: Timeline → Map → Avatar → Panels (all synchronized)
- **Critical Function**: `navigateToLocation()` in `map.js` orchestrates all updates

### Image Loading System
- **Naming Convention**: `{id}_{EnglishCityName}_{code}.jpg`
- **Image Codes**: 0001-0004 per location
- **Path**: `/images/` folder
- **Important**: Always use English city names in paths, not translated names
