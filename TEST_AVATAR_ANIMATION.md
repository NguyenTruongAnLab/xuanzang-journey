# Avatar Animation Testing Guide

This document describes how to test the new animated avatar movement feature along the journey route.

## Testing Prerequisites

1. Open the application in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
2. Ensure JavaScript is enabled
3. The map should load correctly (Leaflet library should not be blocked)

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Flag Display (Desktop UI)
**Expected Result**: Language buttons should show proper flag emojis, not just "GB" and "VI" text

**Steps**:
1. Open the application in desktop view (screen width > 1024px)
2. Look at the top navigation bar
3. Verify the language selector buttons show:
   - UK flag (ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§) for English
   - Vietnamese flag (ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³) for Vietnamese

**Pass Criteria**: Flags appear as colorful emoji icons, not plain text letters

---

### Test 2: Short Distance Animation (Timeline Click)
**Expected Result**: Avatar animates smoothly from one location to an adjacent location

**Steps**:
1. Open the application
2. Observe the monk avatar on the map (should be at Chang'an/Xi'an initially)
3. Click on the second location in the timeline (Wuwei)
4. Watch the avatar animation

**Expected Behavior**:
- Avatar should animate from Xi'an to Wuwei (~2-3 second duration)
- Walking animation should play during movement
- Avatar should stop at Wuwei when animation completes
- Side panel should update to show Wuwei details

**Pass Criteria**: 
- Avatar moves smoothly (not instant jump)
- Walking animation visible during travel
- Avatar stops at correct location

---

### Test 3: Long Distance Animation (Multiple Locations)
**Expected Result**: Avatar animates along the entire route through all intermediate locations

**Steps**:
1. Start at Chang'an (location 0)
2. Click on Bodh Gaya (location 19) in the timeline
3. Watch the avatar animation carefully

**Expected Behavior**:
- Avatar should travel through ALL locations between Xi'an and Bodh Gaya:
  - Xi'an â†’ Wuwei â†’ Dunhuang â†’ Hami â†’ Turpan â†’ Kuqa â†’ Aksu â†’ Tokmok â†’ Tashkent â†’ Samarkand â†’ Balkh â†’ Bamiyan â†’ Kabul â†’ Peshawar â†’ Taxila â†’ Srinagar â†’ Mathura â†’ Kannauj â†’ Varanasi â†’ Bodh Gaya
- Animation should take approximately 6-8 seconds (capped at 8s max)
- Walking animation should play continuously
- Avatar should follow the actual journey route on the map

**Pass Criteria**:
- Avatar moves along the path (not straight line)
- Intermediate locations are traversed
- Animation completes at Bodh Gaya
- Duration feels reasonable (5-8 seconds)

---

### Test 4: Backward Journey Animation
**Expected Result**: Avatar can animate backward along the return journey

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Nalanda (location 20)
2. Click on Dunhuang (location 2) in the timeline
3. Watch the avatar animation

**Expected Behavior**:
- Avatar should travel backward through the route
- Should pass through all intermediate locations in reverse order
- Animation duration should be appropriate for the distance (~6-8 seconds)

**Pass Criteria**:
- Avatar moves backward along historical route
- Animation is smooth
- Stops at correct destination

---

### Test 5: Map Marker Click
**Expected Result**: Clicking a map marker also triggers animated movement

**Steps**:
1. Start at any location
2. Click directly on a map marker (not timeline) that is several locations away
3. Watch the avatar animation

**Expected Behavior**:
- Avatar should animate to clicked location
- Should follow the route (not teleport)
- Walking animation should play
- Duration should scale with distance

**Pass Criteria**:
- Click on map marker triggers animation
- Animation follows route properly
- UI updates correctly

---

### Test 6: Multiple Rapid Clicks
**Expected Result**: New animation should cancel previous animation

**Steps**:
1. Click on a distant location in timeline
2. While animation is in progress, click on a different location
3. Observe behavior

**Expected Behavior**:
- Previous animation should stop immediately
- New animation should start from current position
- No glitches or frozen states
- Avatar should end at the most recently clicked location

**Pass Criteria**:
- Only one animation runs at a time
- No animation artifacts
- Avatar position is correct

---

### Test 7: Language Switching During Animation
**Expected Result**: Language switch doesn't break animation

**Steps**:
1. Start an animation to a distant location
2. While animating, click the Vietnamese flag button
3. Observe behavior

**Expected Behavior**:
- Animation continues smoothly
- UI text updates to Vietnamese
- Avatar continues to destination
- No JavaScript errors in console

**Pass Criteria**:
- Animation completes successfully
- Language changes correctly
- No console errors

## Animation Timing Reference

| Distance (steps) | Expected Duration |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 1 location      | ~2.3 seconds      |
| 2 locations     | ~2.6 seconds      |
| 5 locations     | ~3.5 seconds      |
| 10 locations    | ~5.0 seconds      |
| 15 locations    | ~6.5 seconds      |
| 20+ locations   | ~8.0 seconds (max)|

Formula: `duration = min(2000 + (steps Ã— 300), 8000)` milliseconds

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Map not visible**: If external CDN libraries (Bootstrap, Leaflet) are blocked by ad blockers or network restrictions, the map won't display. This is an environment issue, not a code issue.

2. **Emoji rendering**: Flag emojis may still appear as "GB" and "VI" on very old systems or browsers without emoji font support. Modern browsers should display them correctly.

3. **Animation smoothness**: On very slow devices, animation may appear less smooth due to hardware limitations.

---

## Debugging

If animations don't work as expected, check browser console for errors:

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for JavaScript errors
4. Common issues:
   - "L is not defined" â†’ Leaflet library didn't load
   - "journeyData is not defined" â†’ Data file not loaded
   - "Cannot read property 'coordinates'" â†’ Data structure issue
