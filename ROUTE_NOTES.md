7. Aksu - Western Tarim Basin

**Phase 2: Central Asia (630-632)**
8. Tokmak (Kyrgyzstan) - Western Turkic Khaganate
9. Tashkent (Uzbekistan) - Major Silk Road city
10. Samarkand (Uzbekistan) - Sogdian capital
11. Balkh (Afghanistan) - "Mother of Cities"
12. Bamiyan (Afghanistan) - Famous Buddha statues
13. Kabul (Afghanistan) - Mountain crossing

**Phase 3: Pakistan & Kashmir (632-633)**

**Phase 5: Eastern & Southern India (642)**

### Return Journey (643-645 CE)

24. Kanauj (Return)
25. Kashmir (Return)
26. **Kashgar** - Major rest stop on return (historically visited on outbound too, but not recorded as major stop)
27. Khotan - Southern Silk Road
28. Dunhuang (Return) - Re-entering Chinese territory
29. Chang'an (Return) - Triumphant return with 657 Buddhist texts

## Notes on Kashgar

Kashgar (id: 26) appears only on the return journey in the data. Historically, Xuanzang would have passed through or near Kashgar on the outbound journey between Aksu and Tokmok, but it may not have been recorded as a significant stop. The return journey records emphasize Kashgar as a rest point, which is historically documented.

## Geographic Verification

The route follows logical longitude progression:
- Aksu: 80.26째E
- [Kashgar: 75.99째E - likely passed through]
- Tokmok: 75.29째E
- Tashkent: 69.24째E

The route is geographically sound and follows the historical Silk Road paths.
