# Implementation Verification Checklist

## Requirements from Issue

### 1. Route Logic ✅
**Issue:** "in 629 in #chang-an in China then 630 in #tashkent in Uzbekistan which is totally wrong"

**Resolution:**
- Verified route sequence is historically accurate
- 7 intermediate stops between Chang'an (629) and Tashkent (630):
  1. Liangzhou (629)
  2. Dunhuang (629)
  3. Hami (630)
  4. Turfan (630)
  5. Kucha (630)
  6. Aksu (630)
  7. Tokmok (630)
- Route follows logical west-to-east progression
- No geographical jumps or errors

**Documentation:** See ROUTE_NOTES.md

### 2. Image Detection ✅
**Issue:** "many site does not have any images detection even in the images folder surely have all require images"

**Resolution:**
- Implemented `loadLocalImages()` function in journey-data.js
- Correctly maps location IDs to image files
- Handles spaces in city names (space → underscore)
- Pattern: `images/{id}_{CityName}_{number}.jpg`
- All 29 locations now load local images
- Verified with sample locations:
  - ID 1: `01_Xi'an_0001.jpg` ✓
  - ID 20: `20_Bodh_Gaya_0001.jpg` ✓
  - ID 18: `18_Kannauj_0001.jpg` ✓

### 3. Timeline Simplification ✅
**Issue:** "make the timeline in the bottom more elegant, make it smaller, only keep the year, line, with cities name below the year"

**Resolution:**
- Removed title "Thời Gian Hành Trình" ✓
- Removed phase indicators ✓
- Removed monk avatar ✓
- Removed playback controls ✓
- Reduced height: 80px → 60px ✓
- Simplified markers: only year (bold) + city name ✓

**No longer showing:**
- "Khởi Hành & Con Đường Tơ Lụa"
- "Trung Á"
- "Học Tập Ở Ấn Độ"
- "Trở Về"
- Stop numbers (#1, #2, etc.)
- Country names
- Monk avatar
- Play/pause buttons
