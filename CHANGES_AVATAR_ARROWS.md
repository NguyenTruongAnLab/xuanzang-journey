# Changes: Remove Arrow Directions and Fix Monk Avatar

## Problem Statement
1. Arrow directions on the route were not correct and needed to be removed
2. Monk avatar was not showing on the map
3. Monk avatar was not moving along the path as expected

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Directional Arrows (map.js)
**File**: `map.js`

- **Removed function**: `addDirectionalArrows(pathCoordinates)` (lines ~268-296)
  - This function created arrow markers along the journey path
  - Arrows were placed at 80% of each segment with calculated rotation angles
  - All arrow marker creation code has been removed

- **Removed call**: In `createJourneyPath()` function
  - Removed: `addDirectionalArrows(pathCoordinates);`
  - Now the path is drawn without directional arrow markers

**Why**: The arrow direction was not accurate per user requirements. The journey path itself (red line) is sufficient to show the route.

### 2. Removed Arrow CSS (styles.css)
**File**: `styles.css`

- **Removed styles**: `.journey-arrow` and `.journey-arrow div`
  - All styling for arrow markers has been removed
  - Replaced with comment: `/* Journey direction arrows - REMOVED per user requirements */`

**Why**: CSS was no longer needed after removing the arrow functionality.

### 3. Fixed Monk Avatar Initialization (avatar.js)
**File**: `avatar.js`

- **Modified function**: `initMonkAvatar()`
  - Added: `window.monkAvatar = monkAvatar;`
  - This ensures the monk avatar instance is globally accessible

**Before**:
```javascript
function initMonkAvatar() {
    if (!monkAvatar) {
        monkAvatar = new MonkAvatar();
    }
    return monkAvatar;
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
function initMonkAvatar() {
    if (!monkAvatar) {
        monkAvatar = new MonkAvatar();
        window.monkAvatar = monkAvatar; // Make globally accessible
    }
    return monkAvatar;
}
```

**Why**: The avatar marker needs to be accessible via `window.monkAvatar` for:
- Showing/hiding the marker on the map
- Moving the avatar along the route when locations are selected
- Animating the avatar during playback

## How the Monk Avatar Works

### Avatar Creation Flow:
1. **Initialization** (`DOMContentLoaded` event in map.js):
   - Calls `initMonkAvatar()` → Creates MonkAvatar instance
   - Calls `setMap(map)` → Creates Leaflet marker with monk SVG icon
   - Marker is created but not yet added to map

2. **Display** (on page load or location selection):
   - Calls `moveToLocation(coordinates, duration)` → Adds marker to map if not already present
   - Calls `show()` → Ensures marker is visible on map
   - Avatar appears at the specified coordinates

3. **Animation** (when moving between locations):
   - `moveToLocation()` finds the path between current and target locations
   - `animateAlongPath()` smoothly moves the marker along the route
   - Walking animation is triggered during movement
   - Animation stops when destination is reached

### Key Methods:
- `setMap(map)`: Creates the Leaflet marker with monk SVG icon
- `moveToLocation(coords, duration)`: Moves avatar to coordinates with animation
- `show()`: Adds marker to map and makes it visible
- `hide()`: Removes marker from map
- `startWalking()`: Adds CSS class for walking animation
- `stopWalking()`: Removes CSS class for walking animation

## Expected Behavior After Changes

### 1. No Arrow Markers
- The journey path (red line) is displayed on the map
- No arrow markers appear along the route segments
- The path itself shows the direction of travel from start to end

### 2. Monk Avatar Visible on Map
- When the page loads, the monk avatar appears at Chang'an (first location)
- The avatar is a small SVG monk character positioned on the map

### 3. Monk Avatar Movement
- **Clicking timeline markers**: Avatar animates from current position to selected location
- **Using next/previous buttons**: Avatar moves along the route
- **During playback**: Avatar walks along the entire journey path
- Animation duration scales with distance (2-8 seconds)

### 4. Avatar Appears on Timeline Interactions
- Clicking any timeline marker moves the avatar to that location
- The avatar follows the actual journey route between locations
- Walking animation plays during movement

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing:
1. **Load the page**: 
   - Verify no arrow markers appear on the map
   - Verify monk avatar appears at Chang'an (Xi'an, China)

2. **Click timeline markers**:
   - Click different locations on the timeline
   - Verify avatar smoothly moves from current to selected location
   - Verify avatar follows the route path (not straight line)

3. **Use navigation buttons**:
   - Click "Next location" button repeatedly
   - Verify avatar progresses along the journey
   - Verify walking animation during movement

4. **Test playback** (if play button exists):
   - Click play button
   - Verify avatar automatically walks through all locations
   - Verify animation stops when complete

### Browser Console:
Check for errors related to:
- `window.monkAvatar is undefined`
- `Cannot read property 'moveToLocation' of undefined`
- `L is not defined` (indicates Leaflet library not loaded)

If no errors, the avatar should be working correctly.

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `map.js`: Removed arrow function and call (49 lines removed)
- `styles.css`: Removed arrow CSS (15 lines removed)
- `avatar.js`: Added global reference (1 line added)

### Total Changes:
- **Lines removed**: 64
- **Lines added**: 3
- **Net change**: -61 lines (cleaner, simpler code)

### Compatibility:
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Avatar code already existed, just needed proper initialization
- Removing arrows improves map clarity without losing functionality
